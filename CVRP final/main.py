    Contains all routes found by the nearest neighbor // for all cars (ln 56)

    As long as there is a place with demand: add another car, reset the car's exit position, take the capacity straight from the file; (ln 59 - ln 62)

    As long as the car has capacity: save its last position, if there is no other compatible place;
                                     looks for the position of the nearest place, if there is a place closer, the capacity of the car decreases
                                     according to the demand that the place requested. (ln 65 - ln 69)

    Sums the total distance traveled and informs that the place does not need more delivery and marks the route as already checked. (ln 71 - ln 76)

    If there is no nearest place, add the distance back to the company. (ln 78 - ln 79)

    Tells you how many products are yet to be delivered (ln 82)
